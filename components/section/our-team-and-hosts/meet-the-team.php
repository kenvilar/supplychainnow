														<p>Vicki has a long history of rising to challenges and keeping things up and running.
															First, she supported her family’s multi-million dollar business as controller for 12
															years, beginning at the age of 17. Then, she worked as an office manager and controller
															for a wholesale food broker. But her biggest feat? Serving as the chief executive
															officer of her household, while her entrepreneur husband travelled the world
															extensively. She fed, nurtured, chaperoned, and chauffeured three daughters all while
															running a newsletter publishing business and remaining active in her community as a
															Stephen’s Minister, Sunday school teacher, school volunteer, licensed realtor and POA
															Board president (a title she holds to this day).
														</p>
														<p>A force to be reckoned with in the office, you might think twice before you meet Vicki
															on the tennis court! When she’s not keeping the books balanced at Supply Chain Now or
															playing tennis matches, you can find Vicki traveling, learning Spanish, playing
															pickleball, loving on her 2 grandkids and 2 fur babies, gardening, cleaning (yes, she
															loves to clean!) and learning new things.
